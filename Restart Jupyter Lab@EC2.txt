How to restart Jupyter Lab on AWS EC2

1. restart EC2 from aws, checking the security group policy to allow the ssh and tcp

2. because jupyter lab is installed, you will restart jupyter lab by doing:

# start jupyter lab in the backgroud
screen jupyter lab

Ctrl + A + D to detach the screen
screen -r to reattach

3. configure jupyter to allow external connection

By default, Jupyter Notebook only accepts connections from localhost
configured the jupyter_notebook_config.py file to allow external connections

To create a jupyter_notebook_config.py file, with all the defaults commented out, you can use the following command line:

$ jupyter notebook --generate-config

By modifying the NotebookApp.allow_origin option from the default ' ' to '*', you allow Jupyter to be accessed externally.

c.NotebookApp.allow_origin = '*' #allow all origins

You'll also need to change the IPs that the notebook will listen on:

c.NotebookApp.ip = '0.0.0.0' # listen on all IPs 

4. enter the URL generated from step 2. You can access it from your browser.
